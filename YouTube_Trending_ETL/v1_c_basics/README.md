# YouTube Trending ETL — v1: C Basics

Welcome to the first version of my YouTube Trending Data ETL project! This project demonstrates my foundational skills in learning data engineering using the C programming language.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that reads a sample CSV file containing YouTube trending data. The goal is to showcase basic file I/O, CSV parsing, and data handling in C — essential skills for any data engineer.

## 🚀 What This Project Shows
- **Extract:** Reads raw data from a CSV file (`data/sample_trending_data.csv`).
- **Transform:** (In this version) Simply prints each row. Future versions will include data cleaning and transformation.
- **Load:** (Planned) Later versions will load data into databases or other storage.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- **Language:** C
- **Key Concepts:** File handling, reading CSV, basic ETL logic
- **Structure:**
  - `src/` — C source code for the ETL logic
  - `data/` — Sample CSV data
  - `docs/` — Data schema and ETL design notes

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced low-level data processing and file operations
- Built a foundation for more advanced ETL and data engineering projects
- Demonstrated ability to structure and document a data project professionally

## 👤 About Me
I am a passionate data engineering student, building my skills from the ground up. This project is part of my public learning journey, and I am open to feedback, collaboration, and entry-level opportunities in data engineering or analysis.
